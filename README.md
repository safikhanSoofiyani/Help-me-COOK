<h1>Help me COOK</h1>

People, for as long as we know now, face a common question every day. “What shall I/we cook today??” This simple question many times becomes an irritation to many and often leads to wastage of a lot of time.

This project aims to put an end to this common household question. We are aiming to create a mobile application which hopes to remove this dilemma by suggesting a food item every evening (or whenever required). The user has an option to select the suggested food item or he may also request for another one. The app maintains a favorite food items list and also keeps into account the currently available ingredients and suggests the user a food item accordingly. It also makes sure that the item suggested is not repeated at least within the same week.

By using this application it becomes very easy and takes a lot of pressure off women, especially who are working, as it gives them a full account of the items present in the house and even gives them a suggestion to cook.
